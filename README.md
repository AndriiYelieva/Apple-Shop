## Apple Shop project

This project - this project is the result of my work and research in the field of frontend.

## Technologies Used.

- **React**: My web application is developed using the React library, which provides me with powerful capabilities for creating interactive interfaces.

- **TypeScript**: I use TypeScript to improve the quality of my code and to make it more reliable.

- **JavaScript**: My interfaces are augmented with JavaScript for additional functionality.

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: I follow the BEM methodology for better organization and management of CSS styles.

- **SCSS (Sass)**: I use SCSS to create stylish and well-structured styles for my application.

- **Redux Ñ– Redux Persist**: I use Redux to efficiently manage application state and Redux Persist to preserve that state after a reboot.

- **React Router DOM**: I use React Router DOM to navigate between pages and to create a friendly URL structure.

- **Swiper**: I use Swiper to create interactive carousels and horizontal blocks in my application.
